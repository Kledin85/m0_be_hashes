# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
definitely adding if statements was confusing me.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
going really good I find myself looking at my notes multiple times through an assignment.
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
I usually try and find a solution myself then i go to google after 5 minutes or so if no solution is found.
